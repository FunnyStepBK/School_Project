    <p class="troll">Did you know? The biggest cybersecurity threat is often sitting right in front of the computer. Yes, human errors account for 95% of breaches. Don't be the weak link!</p>

    <h2>Recent Trends in Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
      With the growing complexity of cyber threats, new trends are emerging in the field of cybersecurity:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> AI is now being leveraged to detect anomalies and predict potential threats in real-time.</li>
      <li><strong>Zero Trust Architecture:</strong> A model that assumes breaches can happen at any time, requiring verification for every access attempt.</li>
      <li><strong>Cyber Resilience:</strong> The ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents with minimal disruption.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Cybersecurity is not just an IT concern but a business imperative. As threats evolve, organizations and individuals alike must stay informed and adopt proactive security measures to safeguard their digital lives. Remember: A strong password and a little vigilance go a long way!

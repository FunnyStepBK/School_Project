            <h2>Early Beginnings of Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity has its roots in the early days of computing. In the 1960s, as computer systems began to grow, 
                the need for security measures became apparent. One of the first major instances of cybersecurity 
                issues was the "Morris Worm" of 1988, which was one of the earliest known worms to affect the internet.</p>

            <p>The field gained further importance with the creation of the first firewalls and antivirus software in the 
                1990s, as cyberattacks became more common and damaging. Key figures in the development of modern 
                cybersecurity include "Ron Rivest", who co-invented the RSA encryption algorithm, and "Whitfield Diffie" 
                and "Martin Hellman", who developed the concept of public key cryptography.</p>

            <p class="troll">
                In the 1990s, some believed firewalls were simply the physical walls in IT departments that kept the 
                computers safe from burglars.
            </p>

            <p>However, these early efforts were just the beginning. As the internet grew and digital interactions became 
                more common, cybersecurity challenges expanded. It wasn't long before hackers were testing the limits of 
                encryption, vulnerabilities in operating systems, and software exploits.</p>

            <h2>Modern Day Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>Fast forward to today, and cybersecurity has evolved into a multi-faceted field. With the rise of 
                sophisticated cyberattacks like ransomware, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and phishing scams, the 
                need for robust cybersecurity practices is more critical than ever.</p>

            <p>Now, the cybersecurity landscape is filled with technologies such as "intrusion detection systems", 
                "multi-factor authentication", "encryption", and "blockchain" that aim to protect systems and data 
                from an ever-increasing range of threats. Many organizations also turn to "ethical hackers" or 
                "penetration testers" to proactively find weaknesses in their systems before malicious actors can exploit them.</p>

            <p>In the future, cybersecurity is likely to become even more advanced with the integration of AI and 
                machine learning to detect and defend against cyber threats. In fact, there are already AI systems 
                that can predict and prevent certain types of attacks by analyzing patterns in data and behavior.</p>

            <p class="troll">
                Some experts even joke that the next generation of cybersecurity will involve teaching AI to stop hackers 
                while also ensuring the AI isn't secretly plotting to hack humanity's systems!

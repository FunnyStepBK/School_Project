      <h2>1. Network Security</h2>
      <p>Network Security involves the protection of computer networks from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, or destruction. The goal is to ensure that data traveling across networks is secure and that intruders cannot gain access to sensitive information.</p>
      <p>Techniques used in network security include firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and encryption protocols. These tools help in monitoring, detecting, and preventing malicious activity on a network.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>2. Encryption</h2>
      <p>Encryption is a method used to protect data by converting it into an unreadable format, which can only be decrypted using a specific key. This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read by unauthorized parties.</p>
      <p>Common encryption methods include symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) and asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA). Encryption is used in securing communications, such as emails and online transactions, as well as in data storage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>3. Firewalls</h2>
      <p>Firewalls act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. They monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic and filter out potentially harmful data or access requests.</p>
      <p>There are two main types of firewalls: hardware firewalls, which protect an entire network, and software firewalls, which protect individual devices. Firewalls are a foundational element of any security system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>4. Malware</h2>
      <p>Malware (short for malicious software) refers to any software designed to harm or exploit a device or network. Common types of malware include viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, and trojans.</p>
      <p>Malware can be used for various malicious purposes, including data theft, system disruption, or taking control of infected devices. Defending against malware typically involves using antivirus software, keeping systems up-to-date, and practicing safe browsing habits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>5. Phishing</h2>
      <p>Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal identification details.</p>
      <p>Phishing attacks typically occur via email, but they can also be conducted through phone calls (vishing) or text messages (smishing). Users are encouraged to verify the authenticity of any communication requesting sensitive information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>6. Ethical Hacking</h2>
      <p>Ethical hacking involves authorized attempts to bypass the security systems of an organization in order to identify vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. Ethical hackers, also known as penetration testers, use the same techniques as attackers but with the goal of improving security.</p>
      <p>Ethical hacking is a proactive approach to cybersecurity, ensuring that systems are as secure as possible. It is essential for organizations to regularly assess their defenses through penetration testing to stay ahead of cyber threats.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>7. Cybersecurity Policies and Compliance</h2>
      <p>Cybersecurity policies are guidelines and rules that govern the protection of data and systems within an organization. Compliance refers to the adherence to regulatory standards and industry best practices designed to ensure the protection of sensitive information.</p>
      <p>Common regulations include GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), which mandate certain security measures for protecting personal and health-related data.</p>

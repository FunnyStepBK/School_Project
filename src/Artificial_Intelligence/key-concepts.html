      <h2>1. Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a cornerstone of AI. It focuses on building algorithms that allow machines to learn
        and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML models are trained on data, enabling them to
        make predictions or decisions based on patterns. For example, recommendation systems like those on YouTube or
        Netflix use ML to suggest content tailored to your preferences.</p>
      <p>There are several types of ML techniques, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and
        reinforcement learning. Each has unique applications, ranging from classification problems like email spam
        detection to more complex scenarios like teaching robots to navigate unknown environments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>2. Neural Networks</h2>
      <p>Neural Networks mimic the human brain's structure, consisting of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that process
        and transmit information. These networks form the foundation of **Deep Learning**, a subset of ML that powers
        many AI breakthroughs, such as image recognition and natural language processing (NLP).</p>
      <p>Deep Neural Networks have revolutionized fields like healthcare, enabling early diagnosis of diseases, and
        entertainment, enhancing the realism of visual effects in movies. These networks require massive computational
        power and data, but their potential applications are virtually limitless.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2>
      <p>NLP is the field of AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
        Whether it’s chatbots providing customer support or language translation apps bridging communication gaps, NLP
        technologies are becoming indispensable.</p>
      <p>Key challenges in NLP include context understanding, ambiguity in language, and sentiment analysis. Modern
        techniques, like transformers used in models such as GPT and BERT, have significantly improved machines' ability
        to process natural language.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>4. Computer Vision</h2>
      <p>Computer Vision (CV) allows machines to interpret and analyze visual information from the world. It is used in
        applications like facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging. By analyzing pixels in an image,
        CV algorithms can detect objects, recognize patterns, and even reconstruct 3D environments.</p>
      <p>This field has advanced significantly due to the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which
        specialize in processing image data efficiently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>5. Robotics</h2>
      <p>Robotics is the intersection of AI and mechanical engineering. Robots equipped with AI can perform tasks
        autonomously, from industrial assembly lines to surgical operations. They rely on sensors, actuators, and
        advanced algorithms to navigate, perceive, and interact with their environments.</p>
      <p class="troll">Some researchers joke that robots are just humans without coffee breaks, but the truth is, they
        still can’t figure out how to replace a flat tire on their own.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept">
      <h2>6. Ethical Considerations</h2>
      <p>As AI technologies become more pervasive, ethical questions arise. How do we ensure AI systems make fair
        decisions? What about the impact on employment? Ethical AI involves creating systems that are transparent,
        unbiased, and respect human rights.</p>
      <p>Policymakers and researchers are working to establish guidelines to address these issues, ensuring that AI
        development benefits society as a whole.</p>

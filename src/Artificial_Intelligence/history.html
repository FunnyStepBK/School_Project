            <h2>Early Beginnings of AI</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a concept that dates back to ancient myths, but its real development
                began in
                the 20th century. Early pioneers like "Alan Turing" laid the groundwork for AI with his groundbreaking
                work
                on the "Turing Test", which aimed to measure a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior
                equivalent
                to that of a human.</p>

            <p>In the 1950s, the field of AI was formally established. The creation of the first "AI programs" began
                with
                "John McCarthy", who coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" in 1956. Alongside McCarthy, early
                innovators
                like "Marvin Minsky" and "Allen Newell" started developing the first machine learning models, which were
                the
                precursors to today's advanced algorithms.</p>

            <p class="troll">
                In 1950, Alan Turing was rumored to have created a machine that could play chess and predict the
                weather,
                but it was actually just a really advanced coffee maker.
            </p>

            <p>However, it wasn’t just about algorithms. During this time, scientists were also studying "quasars" and
                "black holes", trying to see if AI could help understand the mysteries of the universe. Despite their
                best
                efforts, AI was still many decades away from becoming what we know today.</p>

            <h2>Modern Day AI</h2>
            <p>Fast forward to the 21st century, and AI has experienced a rapid transformation, largely due to
                advancements
                in "machine learning", "deep learning", and the availability of vast amounts of data. Thanks to powerful
                computers and algorithms, AI can now perform tasks that once seemed impossible, like "image
                recognition",
                "natural language processing", and even "autonomous driving".</p>

            <p>Notably, companies like "Google", "Amazon", and "Microsoft" have pushed AI further into the mainstream,
                integrating AI-powered systems into their products like "virtual assistants", "recommendation engines",
                and
                "cloud-based AI services". These developments have led to a boom in AI research, with applications now
                spanning industries from healthcare to entertainment.</p>

            <p>In fact, as AI continues to evolve, there’s talk about AI becoming self-aware. Some speculate
                that one day, AI could even start having "dreams about space travel", powered by the very algorithms it
                helped develop.</p>
